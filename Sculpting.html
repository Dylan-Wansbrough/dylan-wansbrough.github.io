		<div id = "project2">
			<p>Over the course of 4 weeks we had to design a character that will express a number of poses, each capturing a moment in time using a variety of angles in order to highlight the shape and material qualities of the character. This involved using sculpting tools such as 3D coat for the first time. It was quite a hard project, especially as we had to learn sculpting and 3D coat as we progressed through the course. We had to create 3 poses that represent our character and show off their personality. </p>
			<p>In the 4 weeks I learnt a lot of new skills and had to overcome many new challenges. While there were a few challenges I couldn't overcome due to time I am still happy with the outcome. The character is rigged including finger ringing, although the face was not rigged but manually changed. Sadly I didn't get to put as much effort as I would have liked into the settings but due to time I had to make something quick.</p>
