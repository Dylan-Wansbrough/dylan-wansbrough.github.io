				<div id="projTextH1"><h3>Sculpting Project</h3></div>
				<p>This was a project at University based around learning to 3D sculpt organic models using programs such as 3D-Coat or Z-Brush.</p>
				<p>When: Q2 2018</p>
				<p>Where: <a href="https://www.victoria.ac.nz/">Victoria University of Wellington</a></p>
				<p>Programs used: <a href="https://3dcoat.com/v48/">3D-Coat</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.nz/products/maya/overview">Maya2018</a></p>
				<p>Skills: Sculpting, materials, texture painting, PBR, lighting, rendering, composition, rigging</p>

		<div id="projTextH1"><h1>About the project</h1></div>
		<div id = "project2">
			<p>Over the course of 4 weeks we had to design a character that will express a number of poses, each capturing a moment in time using a variety of angles in order to highlight the shape and material qualities of the character. This involved using sculpting tools such as 3D-Coat for the first time. It was quite a hard project, especially as we had to learn sculpting and 3D-Coat as we progressed through the course. We had to create 3 poses that represent our character and show off their personality. </p>
			<p>In the 4 weeks I learnt a lot of new skills and had to overcome many new challenges. The character is rigged including finger ringing, although the face was not rigged but manually changed. Sadly I didn't get to put as much effort as I would have liked into the settings but due to time I had to make something quick. <b>Im currently working on redesigning this model as I wasnt happy with it.</b> Im currently starting with the anatomy. The outfit, Hair and face will be completely redesigned, probably with a cyberpunk theme.</p>
