				<p>This was a course design around incorperating the use of VR into our design and modelling.</p>
				<p>When: Q2 2018</p>
				<p>Where: <a href="https://www.victoria.ac.nz/">Victoria University of Wellington</a></p>
				<p>Programs used: <a href="https://3dcoat.com/v48/">3D-Coat</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.nz/products/maya/overview">Maya2018</a>, <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.6.3p1">Unity 5.6.3p1</a></p>
				<p>Skills: Game engine pipelines, character animation, VR design lighting, UV unwrapping, 3D modelling </p>

		<div id = "project2">
			<p>In this project, I had to create a world comprised of two animated scenes using Unity, Maya and 3D-Coat to be displayed using a VR headset. Each scene can be viewed from a different perspective, and uses scale as the differing factor between the two in order to communicate a perspective that would not be possible to achieve with any other technology. The world is visible inside of <a href="https://www.vrchat.net/">VRChat</a> but is currently private. </p>
			<p>This project was my first time using Unity and the VRChat SDK. Both had very straight forward and easy to use features which made it easy to pick up. The main this I struggled with is having to make everything as perfect as possible. This is because unlike a rendered image I cant hide faults in the modelling from the camera as the user is able to look at it from any angle. This meant that I had to work mainly on my UV skills as I had to try make everything seamless. Some models were supplied from the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Assest Store</a>.</p>
